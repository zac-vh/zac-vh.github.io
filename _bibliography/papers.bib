  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*‚Ä†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract= "We define the Wigner entropy of a quantum state as the differential Shannon entropy of the Wigner function of the state. This quantity is properly defined only for states that possess a positive Wigner function, which we name Wigner-positive states, but we argue that it is a proper measure of quantum uncertainty in phase space. It is invariant under symplectic transformations (displacements, rotations, and squeezing) and we conjecture that it is lower bounded by ln‚Å°ùúã+1 within the convex set of Wigner-positive states. It reaches this lower bound for Gaussian pure states, which are natural minimum-uncertainty states. This conjecture bears a resemblance with the Wehrl-Lieb conjecture, and we prove it over the subset of passive states of the harmonic oscillator which are of particular relevance in quantum thermodynamics. Along the way, we present a simple technique to build a broad class of Wigner-positive states exploiting an optical beam splitter and reveal an unexpectedly simple convex decomposition of extremal passive states. The Wigner entropy is anticipated to be a significant physical quantity, for example, in quantum optics where it allows us to establish a Wigner entropy-power inequality. It also opens a way towards stronger entropic uncertainty relations. Finally, we define the Wigner-R√©nyi entropy of Wigner-positive states and conjecture an extended lower bound that is reached for Gaussian pure states."
